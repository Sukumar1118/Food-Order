-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåê 1. What is HTTP?

### **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**  
- **Application Layer Protocol** used to transfer data between **client** (browser) and **server**.
- It‚Äôs **stateless**, **text-based**, and works over **TCP**.
- Default ports: **80** (HTTP), **443** (HTTPS)

### Key Features:
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent.
- **Request/Response model**.
- Supports methods: **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH**, etc.

---

## üîó 2. What is TCP?

### **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- **Transport Layer protocol**.
- Ensures **reliable**, **ordered**, and **error-checked** delivery of data.

### Why is it needed?
HTTP uses TCP because:
- TCP breaks large data into smaller packets.
- Reassembles them at the destination.
- Retransmits lost packets.
- Guarantees **data delivery** in correct order.

---

## ü§ù 3. TCP Handshake (3-Way Handshake)

Establishes a **reliable connection** before data is sent:

### **Steps**:
1. **SYN**: Client sends SYN to server (synchronize).
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with SYN-ACK (acknowledge + sync).
3. **ACK**: Client sends ACK (acknowledges server).

‚úÖ Now the **TCP connection is established**, and HTTP can send data over it.

---

## üìä 5. Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **GET** | Fetch a resource |
| **POST** | Submit data to server (e.g., form) |
| **PUT** | Update a resource |
| **DELETE** | Delete a resource |
| **PATCH** | Partial update |

---

## üíº 7. Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | How HTTP + TCP Work |
|----------|---------------------|
| Web browsing | Request pages via HTTP over TCP |
| API communication | REST APIs use HTTP to exchange data |
| File upload/download | Uploads via POST/PUT, downloads via GET |
| Mobile apps | Talk to servers using HTTP/HTTPS |
| IoT devices | Send sensor data over HTTP (often via REST APIs) |

---

## üìå Quick Summary

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **HTTP** | Application-layer protocol for communication |
| **TCP** | Transport-layer protocol for reliable delivery |
| **Handshake** | Establishes TCP connection before HTTP |
| **Request-Response** | Core of HTTP communication model |

------------------------------------------------------------------

### ‚úÖ 1. **What is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)?**

**TCP** is a **connection-oriented protocol** that ensures reliable data transmission between two devices on a network.

#### üîë Key Features:
- **Reliable**: Guarantees data delivery (retransmits lost packets)
- **Ordered**: Maintains the order of packets
- **Error-Checked**: Verifies packet integrity
- **Flow Control**: Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver
- **Congestion Control**: Avoids network overload

#### üì¶ How it works:
- Breaks data into **packets**
- Numbers them for correct order
- Sends them over the internet
- Reassembles them at the destination

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **TCP Handshake (3-Way Handshake)**

Before data can be exchanged, **TCP establishes a connection** using a 3-step process:

#### üîÑ Steps:
1. **SYN** ‚Äì Client sends a connection request (SYN = synchronize)
2. **SYN-ACK** ‚Äì Server acknowledges (SYN-ACK)
3. **ACK** ‚Äì Client confirms with ACK (acknowledgment)

This **3-way handshake** ensures:
- Both parties are ready
- Ports are open
- Initial sequence numbers are synchronized

> üìù After this, the TCP connection is **established** and data transmission can begin.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Why is TCP required in HTTP?**

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an **application-layer protocol** used for communication between web clients (like browsers) and servers. But HTTP itself is **stateless and unreliable** ‚Äî it needs **TCP** to ensure reliable transport.

#### üí° Reasons HTTP uses TCP:
| Feature             | Why it's important for HTTP |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Reliability**      | Web pages, files, APIs must load completely without data loss |
| **Ordering**         | HTML, CSS, JS must arrive in correct sequence |
| **Error Checking**   | Detects and corrects corruption |
| **Connection Management** | TCP handles session start/close (through handshake and teardown) |
| **Stream-oriented** | HTTP can send data as a stream (good for large data) |

---

### ‚úÖ Bonus: HTTP vs TCP (Quick Comparison)

| Protocol | Layer          | Role                      |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| HTTP     | Application    | Defines how web clients and servers communicate (what data to send) |
| TCP      | Transport      | Handles **how** the data gets sent (reliable, ordered, error-checked) |

---

### ‚úÖ Final Summary:

- **TCP** is a transport protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, error-checked communication.
- **HTTP** relies on TCP for data transmission.
- The **TCP 3-way handshake** is used to establish a reliable connection before any HTTP communication starts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üß© **What is HTTP/3?**

**HTTP/3** is the **third major version** of the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**, succeeding HTTP/2.  
Unlike HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 which are built on **TCP**, HTTP/3 is built on **QUIC**, a transport protocol that runs over **UDP**.

> ‚úÖ **HTTP/3 = HTTP semantics + QUIC transport layer (over UDP)**

---

### üöÄ **What is QUIC?**

**QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)** is a **transport layer network protocol** developed by Google and now standardized by the IETF.

- It provides features similar to TCP + TLS + HTTP/2 multiplexing, but more efficiently.
- Runs over **UDP**, not TCP.

---

### üì¶ **UDP vs TCP: Core Differences**

| Feature        | TCP                                | UDP                            |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Connection     | Connection-oriented (3-way handshake) | Connectionless (no handshake)   |
| Reliability    | Reliable, ordered, error-checked    | Unreliable, no order guarantee |
| Latency        | Higher (due to handshake and retransmission) | Lower (no handshake)         |
| Use Cases      | Web, email, file transfers          | Video, VoIP, gaming, DNS       |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Why HTTP/3 Uses UDP (via QUIC)**

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Connection Establishment is Faster**
- QUIC combines **TLS handshake + transport connection** in a **single round-trip**.
- Reduces latency drastically (compared to TCP + TLS which requires 2‚Äì3 round-trips).

#### ‚úÖ 2. **No Head-of-Line (HoL) Blocking**
- In TCP, packet loss on one stream blocks all others (HoL blocking).
- QUIC supports **independent, multiplexed streams**‚Äîloss in one doesn‚Äôt affect others.

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Better Connection Migration**
- QUIC connections can **migrate across IPs** (e.g., switching Wi-Fi to 4G) without breaking.
- Uses **Connection IDs** that abstract the underlying IP/port.

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Improved Performance in Mobile/Real-Time Scenarios**
- More resilient to network changes and packet loss.
- Great for **mobile apps, video calls, live streaming**.

#### ‚úÖ 5. **Built-in Encryption**
- QUIC has **mandatory TLS 1.3 encryption** built-in at the transport layer.

---

### üß† **Why Not Just Use TCP?**
- TCP is deeply integrated into OS kernels.
- Updating or modifying TCP requires OS-level changes.
- QUIC being **user-space** protocol over **UDP** means **faster iteration, optimization, and deployability** (no kernel update needed).

---

### üîß Real-World Use Cases of HTTP/3 (QUIC)

| Domain       | Use Case                                   | Benefit from HTTP/3 (QUIC)           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| üé• Streaming | YouTube, Netflix, etc.                      | Lower latency, better packet loss handling |
| üì± Mobile    | WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.                   | Fast reconnection after switching networks |
| üì° Realtime  | Video conferencing (Zoom, Meet), gaming     | Reduced latency, no HoL blocking     |
| üåç Web       | Google Search, Facebook                     | Faster page loads, quick handshakes  |
| üåê CDN       | Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly                  | Improved delivery of static assets   |

---

### üîí Security in QUIC

- Encrypted by default using **TLS 1.3**.
- Protects both headers and payload.
- Reduces metadata leakage compared to HTTP/2.

---

# üìò HTTPS Protocol ‚Äì Technical Notes

---

## üîí What is HTTPS?

**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the secure version of HTTP, used for secure communication over a network (especially the Internet).

> ‚úÖ **HTTPS = HTTP + TLS (formerly SSL)**

It ensures:
- üîê **Encryption** ‚Äì Hides data from attackers
- üìå **Authentication** ‚Äì Confirms identity via certificates
- üì¶ **Data Integrity** ‚Äì Ensures data isn't modified in transit

---

## üß± Components of HTTPS

### 1. **HTTP** ‚Äì The base protocol for communication
- Plaintext
- Not secure

### 2. **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**
- Encrypts HTTP traffic
- Secures data transmission
- Replaces the older SSL protocol

> üîÅ HTTPS = HTTP (application layer) + TLS (security layer) + TCP (transport layer)

---

## üîê Key Features of HTTPS

| Feature            | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Encryption**     | Converts data into unreadable format during transit |
| **Authentication** | Uses SSL/TLS certificates to verify server identity |
| **Data Integrity** | Ensures transmitted data isn't tampered with |
| **Confidentiality**| Prevents eavesdropping |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è TLS Handshake Process (Simplified)

1. **Client Hello** ‚Äì Sends supported TLS versions, cipher suites, random number.
2. **Server Hello** ‚Äì Sends chosen TLS version, cipher, and SSL certificate.
3. **Certificate Verification** ‚Äì Client validates server certificate (via CA).
4. **Key Exchange** ‚Äì Shared session key created using asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA, Diffie-Hellman).
5. **Secure Communication** ‚Äì All further data is encrypted using symmetric encryption.

---

## üßæ SSL Certificates

Issued by **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** to validate identity.

### Types:
- **DV (Domain Validation)** ‚Äì Basic domain ownership
- **OV (Organization Validation)** ‚Äì Includes business verification
- **EV (Extended Validation)** ‚Äì Highest level of verification (shows green padlock or org name)

---

## üåê HTTPS vs HTTP

| Feature         | HTTP           | HTTPS                          |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Encryption      | ‚ùå No           | ‚úÖ Yes                         |
| Port            | 80             | 443                            |
| SEO             | Lower          | Google prefers HTTPS           |
| Certificate     | ‚ùå Not needed   | ‚úÖ Required                    |
| Security Level  | ‚ùå Not secure   | ‚úÖ Secure with TLS             |

---

## üîå Does HTTPS Use TCP?

‚úÖ **Yes, HTTPS uses TCP as its transport layer protocol.**

### üìö Protocol Stack:

```
Application Layer:     HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)
Security Layer:        TLS
Transport Layer:       TCP
Network Layer:         IP
```

### Why not just TCP?

Because:
- TCP only provides reliability (ordering, retransmission) but **no encryption**.
- Anyone intercepting TCP packets can read data.
- TLS adds security features **on top of TCP**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: HTTPS Communication Flow

1. **TCP Handshake** (3-way): Establishes a reliable connection.
2. **TLS Handshake**: Authenticates server & establishes encryption keys.
3. **Encrypted HTTP Requests**: Sent over the secure TLS session using TCP.

---

## üì¶ Real Example

### HTTP:
```http
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic admin:123456
```
üò± Sent in **plaintext**, easily interceptable.

### HTTPS (TLS-encrypted):
```http
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic admin:123456
```
‚úÖ Same request, but encrypted ‚Äì cannot be read in transit.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Using HTTPS

- üîí Secure sensitive data (logins, payments)
- üõ° Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- üìà Improve SEO (Google ranking)
- üîó Required for many modern web features (e.g., PWAs, APIs)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîå WebSocket Protocol ‚Äì Overview

**WebSocket** is a **communication protocol** that provides **full-duplex** (two-way), **persistent** communication channels over a **single TCP connection**.

It‚Äôs ideal for real-time applications like:
- Chat apps
- Live notifications
- Gaming
- Stock tickers
- Collaborative tools

---

## üåê Traditional HTTP vs WebSocket

| Feature            | HTTP                     | WebSocket                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Protocol Type      | Request/Response (Half-duplex) | Full-duplex               |
| Connection         | Short-lived              | Long-lived (persistent)   |
| Overhead           | High (headers each time) | Low (after initial handshake) |
| Use Case           | Static websites, APIs    | Real-time apps            |

---

## üîÑ HTTP Upgrade to WebSocket

WebSocket starts as an **HTTP connection**, then requests an **upgrade** to a WebSocket connection.

### ‚úÖ Handshake Process

1. **Client sends HTTP request** with upgrade headers:
```http
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

2. **Server responds with**:
```http
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
```

üîê The `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` is a hashed value derived from `Sec-WebSocket-Key` + a GUID.

üîÅ Once the handshake is successful, the HTTP connection **upgrades** to a **WebSocket connection**.

---

## üîÄ Full Duplex Communication

### üß† What is Full Duplex?
**Full-duplex** means both the **client and server can send and receive data simultaneously**, without waiting for a response (like a phone call, not a walkie-talkie).

### üï≥ How it Works in WebSocket:
- A **single TCP connection** is kept open.
- Messages can flow in **both directions at the same time**.
- You can send small or large binary/text frames with low overhead.

---

## üì¶ WebSocket Message Frames

WebSocket sends data in **frames**, not as full HTTP messages:
- Text frame
- Binary frame
- Ping/Pong (heartbeat)
- Close frame

Example:
```javascript
socket.send("Hello Server!"); // Sends text data
```
---

## üîí Security

- Use `wss://` (WebSocket over TLS) for encryption (like HTTPS).
- Same-origin policy and CORS-like restrictions don‚Äôt apply to WebSocket.
- Server should validate the origin to prevent Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Key Term          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| WebSocket         | Protocol for full-duplex, persistent communication |
| HTTP Upgrade      | Initial handshake to switch from HTTP to WebSocket |
| Full Duplex       | Two-way communication over a single TCP connection |
| Use Cases         | Real-time apps (chat, gaming, stock updates) |
| Protocol Ports    | Usually port **80 (ws)** or **443 (wss)** |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üí° **What is SMTP?**

**SMTP** stands for **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**.  
It is an **application-layer protocol** used to **send** and **relay outgoing emails** from a client to a server or between servers.

---

### üì¨ **Purpose of SMTP**

- Sending emails from an **email client (like Outlook, Gmail)** to an **email server**
- **Relaying emails** between servers (for example, from Gmail‚Äôs servers to Yahoo‚Äôs servers)
- It does **not handle receiving** or storing emails (that‚Äôs done by **IMAP** or **POP3**)

---

### üìå **How SMTP Works (Basic Flow)**

1. **User composes an email** in an email client.
2. Email client contacts the SMTP server (usually on **port 25**, **587**, or **465**).
3. SMTP server processes the **sender**, **recipient**, **subject**, and **message body**.
4. SMTP server checks the **domain of the recipient** and:
   - If it's the same domain ‚Üí delivers directly.
   - If it's a different domain ‚Üí relays to the recipient's SMTP server.
5. The recipient server **queues** the message and later **delivers it to the user inbox** using **IMAP or POP3**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Common SMTP Ports**

| Port | Use Case                            | Encryption         |
|------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 25   | Default for SMTP (server to server) | Often blocked by ISPs |
| 587  | Client to server (submission)       | STARTTLS encryption |
| 465  | Legacy port                         | SSL/TLS encryption  |

---

### üîê **SMTP Commands**

SMTP uses simple **text-based commands**, such as:

| Command | Description                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| HELO    | Identify the client to the server    |
| MAIL FROM | Specifies sender's email address |
| RCPT TO | Specifies recipient's email address |
| DATA    | Starts the body of the email         |
| QUIT    | Ends the SMTP session                |

Example session:
```
HELO mail.example.com
MAIL FROM:<alice@example.com>
RCPT TO:<bob@example.com>
DATA
Subject: Hello
This is a test email.
.
QUIT
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **SMTP Authentication**

Modern SMTP servers require **authentication** (username/password) before sending mail to:
- Prevent **spam**
- Ensure **sender identity**
- Allow **secure sending**

---

### üîÑ **SMTP vs POP3 vs IMAP**

| Feature         | SMTP         | POP3           | IMAP             |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Purpose        | Sending mail | Receiving mail | Receiving mail   |
| Storage        | Server ‚Üí Server | Downloads and deletes | Syncs with server |
| Port (default) | 25 / 587     | 110            | 143 / 993        |

---

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of SMTP**

- Simple and well-supported
- Works across networks and platforms
- Efficient for relaying mail

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**

- No encryption in default form (plaintext)
- No email fetching (only sending)
- Can be misused for **spamming** if not secured

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üåê **What is FTP?**

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is a standard network protocol used to **transfer files between a client and a server** over a TCP/IP-based network like the internet.

---

### üß± **How FTP Works**

1. **Client-Server Architecture**:
   - The **client** initiates a connection to the **FTP server** to upload/download files.
   - Users typically use FTP clients like **FileZilla**, or command-line tools.

2. **Control and Data Channels**:
   - **Control Connection (Port 21)**: Used for sending commands (e.g., login, list directories).
   - **Data Connection (Port 20 or dynamic)**: Used for actual file transfer.

---

### üîê **Authentication**

- Most FTP servers require a **username and password**.
- Some servers allow **anonymous access** (read-only, no login required).

---

### üîÑ **Modes of FTP**

1. **Active Mode**:
   - Client opens a port and waits.
   - Server connects back to the client to transfer data.

2. **Passive Mode** (more firewall-friendly):
   - Server opens a port and waits.
   - Client initiates both control and data connections.

---

### üîí **Is FTP Secure?**

**Standard FTP is not secure**:
- Sends data (including credentials) in **plain text**.
- Vulnerable to **packet sniffing** and **man-in-the-middle attacks**.

üëâ To secure FTP:
- Use **FTPS (FTP Secure)**: FTP over SSL/TLS.
- Use **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**: Completely different protocol using SSH.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Common FTP Commands**
