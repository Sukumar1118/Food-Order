# Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
    # It means that parcel will keep a track of all the files which you are updating.
    # There is File Watcher Algorithm (written in C++). It keeps track of all the files
        which are changing realtime and it tells the server to reload. These are all done by PARCEL.

# Transitive Dependencies :
    # We have our package manager which takes care of our transitive dependencies of our code.
    # If we’ve to build a production ready app which uses all optimisations 
        (like minify, bundling, compression, etc), we need to do all these.
    # But we can’t do this alone, we need some dependencies on it. Those dependencies are also 
        dependent on other dependencies.

# Browserslist:
    # Browserslist is a tool that specifies which browsers should be supported/compatible in your frontend app.
    # It makes our code compatible for a lot of browsers.

# what is Tree Shaking?
   ● Tree shaking is a process of removing the unwanted code that we do not use while developing 
        the application.
   ● In computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.


=====================

###  What is `npm`?
   ● npm is a package manager primarily for JavaSript.
   ● npm actually has `no full form` but many places it is mentioned as `Node Package Manager`.
   ● npm is world's largest software registry where developers(or many organizations) can share 
        or borrow packages for projects.

# Package Manager:
  ● Package manager is a tool that helps to `manage the dependencies` in the Project.
  ● It automates the process of `installing, upgrading & removing packages` and helps 
    to develop & miantain applications easily.
    EX: `npm`, `yarn` etc.

# Module:
   ● A module is a `single file (or group of files)` containing JavaScript code that can be 
        exported and used in other files by importing it.
   ● It `encapsulates related functionality`, for code organization and reusability.
   ● You can define modules using `import and export` statements in JS(ES6 modules).

# Package:
   ● A package is a `collection of modules` that are bundled together and distributed as 
        a single unit.
   ● It includes a `package.json` file that contains `meta data`, `dependencies`, `versioning` etc.
   ● It can be installed via package manager like `npm or yarn`.

# Library:
   ● A library is a `collection of reusable code` that provides specific functionalities. 
   ● It can be a `single module` or a `collection of modules (or a package)`.

# NOTE:
   ● All above definitions are generic for module, package & library.
   ● In `JS(or in npm ecosystem)`, these terminologies are used `interchangably`.
   EX: `React` is considered as both `package & library`.
        React is a library provide functionalities for building web apps.
        React is distributed as a npm package which can be installed via npm and
        it also has package.json file.

# CLI(Command Line Interface):
  ● CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with programs via a comman line or terminal.
  ● CLI takes input as text & responds with text as output unlike GUIs(no need of GUIs).

# CLI Tools:
  ● CLI Tools are `command-line-based applications` instead of GUI to perform tasks in command
    prompt or terminal.
    EX: npm (npm install react),
        Git (git clone <repository-url>),
        Angular CLI (ng serve),
        Webpack CLI (webpack --config webpack.config.js)

   ● `Uses`:
        - They are `speed, flexible` and `ease of automation`.
        - They are more eficient to manage & streamline development process and manage apps.
        - Useful in managing `remote servers`, where GUIs may not be available or practical.

   ● How to get `CLI Tools`?
   ● `NPM`:
        - npm, node, npx from `Node.js`(.msi installer file).
        - npm is maintained by `Microsoft`(through its subsidiary `GitHub`) and 
            is an `open-source` tool.
   ● `Git`:
        - git, git bash from `Git`(.exe file).
        - Git is maintained by the `Linux Foundation` and is an `open-source` tool.

   ● Both `npm & git` through CLI using `winget`(included in WIN 10, 11) or `Chocolatey`.

# Terminal:
   ● Terminal in VS Code is an `integrated command-line interface` (CLI).
   ● It allows you to execute commands directly within the editor, without switching 
        to an external terminal application.
        
    EX: powershell (Windows (available on macOS and Linux too)),
        command prompt (Windows),
        Git Bash (Cross-platform (part of Git for Windows)),
        Javascript debug terminal (Cross-platform, integrated with VS Code’s debugging environment).

# Git:
   ● Git is `Version Control System` (VCS).
   ● Command-line tool used for `tracking changes` in source code during development.
   ● Provides features like `branching`, `merging`, `committing`, and `viewing history` etc.

# GitHub:
   ● `Hosting service` for Git repositories & a `Web-based platform` for `project management`
        and community engagement.
   ● UI for git and provides features such as `issue tracking`, `pull requests`, 
        and `collaboration tools`.
   ● Similar platforms like GitHub: `GitLab`, `Bitbucket` etc.

# To make our app production ready what should we do?
   ● `Minify our file` (Remove console logs, bundle things up).
   ● `Need a server` to run things.

📢 NOTE: Minify —> Optimization —> Clean console —> Bundle

# What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
   ● Parcel/Webpack is `module bundler`.
   ● Used to `bundle and package` JS applications and their dependencies.

# Bundlers:
   ● A bundler is a tool that `bundles & packages` our app into one or more output files.
        This optimized files can be shipped to production.
    Examples of Bundlers:
                    1. Webpack (create-react-app uses this bundler).
                    2. Parcel.
                    3. Vite.
   ● Bundlers are packages.

# Configuring the Project:
   ● `npm init`
   ● It creates a package.json file.

# package.json:
   ● Package.json file is a `configuration` for `NPM and the project`.
   ● Install packages our project needs using: 
        `npm install <packageName>`.
   ● Once package installation is complete, their versions and configuration related 
        information is stored as dependencies inside package.json file

# Now to install parcel we will do:
   ● npm install -D parcel
   ● Now we will get a `package-lock.json` file.

# package-lock.json:
   ● Package-lock.json locks the `exact version` of packages being used in the project.
   ● `npm install` - npm `automatically` creates or updates `package-lock.json` to 
        reflect any new dependencies or updates.
   ● `Do not edit manually`, since it is automatically generated & `managed by npm`.     
   ● package-lock.json ensures a `stable, consistent environment` by locking dependency versions,
        making npm installations reliable and predictable.

# Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
   ● package-lock.json it is automatically generated and managed by npm to 
        `ensure dependency consistency`. 
   ● Making manual changes to package-lock.json can cause `issues in dependency management`, 
        leading to potential `bugs or unexpected behaviors`.

# What is difference between package.json and package.lock.json?
   ● In `package. json` we have information about `generic version` of installed packages.
   ● In `package.lock.json` we have information about the `specific or exact version` of installed packages.

# What is node_modules?
   ● All packages which are installed are like `database for the npm`.
   ● node_modules folder is essential for `managing project dependencies locally`.
   ● Every `dependency` in node_module will have its `package.json`.
   ● Node modules are very heavy so we should always put this in `git ignore`.

# 📢 NOTE: Never touch node_modules and package-lock.json

# What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
   ● .gitignore file specifies files and directories that `Git should ignore` when
        `tracking changes` in a repository.

   ● `Should add` to .gitignore:
    Ex: 1. Dependency folders like `node_modules` - these can be `regenerated` by like 
            npm using package.json.
        2. `Build output` files like `dist, build` etc.
        3. `Generated test` coverage reports like `coverage` etc.

   ● `Should not add` to .gitignore:
    Ex: 1. `Core application code` (like .js, .py, .html files) should always be 
                tracked by Git.
        2. `Configuration files` like package.json, webpack.config.js etc.
        3. `Documentation files` and other important project files like  `README.md`,
                `LICENSE`, `.gitignore` etc.

# Is it a good idea to push node_modules that on git?
   ● `No`, it’s generally not a good idea to push the node_modules folder to Git.
   ● Adding node_modules to .gitignore and `excluding it from version` control is a 
        best practice.
   ● It keeps the repository `lightweight and efficient`, because node_modules contains 
        not just dependencies mentioned in package.json and also it's `internal dependencies`.
   ● Dependency information in package.json and package-lock.json ensures 
        `version consistency`.

# To ignite our app:
   ● `npx parcel index.html`
   ● npx means `execute using npm` & index.html is the entry point.

# What is npx ?
   ● npx is a `CLI tool` that comes bundled with npm and is used to 
        `execute packages directly from the npm registry` without needing to install
        them globally or locally first.

    Ex: npx create-react-app my-app
   ● This command `temporarily installs create-react-app`, runs it, and then removes it. 
   ● This helps saving you from `managing it as a global or project dependency`.
   ● If `it's dependency` is mentioned in package.json it `will install` it and can be seen 
        in node modules.

# What is .parcel-cache?
   ● Parcel `caches code` all the time.
   ● When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
   ● If we make any code changes and save the application, another build will be triggered which 
        might take even less time than the previous build. 
        This `reduction of time` is due to parcel cache.
   ● Parcel immediately loads the code from the `cache every time there is a subsequent build`.
   ● On the very `first build` parcel creates a `folder .parcelcache` where it stores the caches in 
        `binary code format`.
   ● Parcel gives `faster build`, `faster developer experience` because of caching.

# dist:
   ● It keeps the `files minified` for us.
   ● When `bundler builds the app`, the build goes into a folder called `dist`.
   ● The /dist folder contains the `minimized and optimised` version of the `source code`.
   ● Along with the minified code, the /dist folder also comprises of all the compiled modules that 
        may or may not be used with other systems.

   ● When we run command:
            `npx parcel index.html`
        -> This will create a faster development version of our project and serves it on the server.
    
   ● When I tell parcel to make a `production build`:
            `npx parcel build index.html`
        -> It creates a lot of things, `minify your file`. 
        -> And the parcel will build all the production files to the dist folder.

# ^ (caret) and ~ (tilde)
   ● In package.json, the ^ and ~ symbols specify `version ranges for npm packages`.
   ● `^ (Caret)` - Allows updates to `minor & patch versions`, but restricts major version updates.
   Ex: "express": "^4.17.1"
        -> "^4.17.1" version will match any version >=4.17.1 <5.0.0
   ● `~ (tilde)` = Allowa updates to `patch versions only`, but restricts minor & major updates.
   Ex: "express": "~4.17.1"
        -> "~4.17.1" version will match any version >=4.17.1 <4.18.0
   ● To `update package-lock.json` with the latest version, you typically use:
                -> `npm update` for specific packages,
                -> `Modify package.json` version ranges directly,
                -> `npm install package@latest`,
                -> `Delete package.lock.json` & install again
    With above methods, npm will then install and lock the latest versions within the specified range.

# What is difference between dependencies vs devDependencies?
●   Aspect	          |  dependencies	                         | devDependencies
    Purpose	          |  Required to run the app in production	 | Needed only for development tasks
    Example Packages  |  express, react, axios	                 | webpack, eslint, jest
    Installation	  |  Installed in all environments by default| Skipped in production installs
    Cmd to install    |	 npm install <package>	                 | npm install <package> --save-dev
