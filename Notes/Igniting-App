# - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
    # `Parcel/Webpack` is module bundler used to bundle and package JS applications and their dependencies.

# Bundlers:
    # A bundler is a tool that bundles our app, packages our app so that it can be shipped 
        to production.
    Examples of Bundlers:
                    1. Webpack (create-react-app uses this bundler).
                    2. Parcel.
                    3. Vite.
    # Bundlers are packages.

                    2. Vite
                    3. Parcel
# üì¢ NOTE: In create-react-app, the bundler used is webpack.

# Package Manager:
    # Bundlers are packages. If we want to use a package in our code, we have to use a package manager.
    # We use a package manager known as:
                                    1. npm or 
                                    2. yarn

# Configuring the Project:
    npm init
    -> It creates a package.json file.

# Now to install parcel we will do:
    npm install -D parcel
    -> Now we will get a package-lock.json file.

# package.json:
    # Package.json file is a configuration for NPM. 

    # Whatever packages our project needs, we install those packages using:
            npm install <packageName>.

    # Once package installation is complete, their versions and configuration related 
        information is stored as dependencies inside package.json file.

# package-lock.json:
    # Package-lock.json locks the exact version of packages being used in the project.

# What is difference between package.json and package.lock.json?
    In package. json we have information about generic version of installed packages whereas
        in package.lock.json we have information about the specific or exact version of
        installed packages.

# node_modules:
    # Which gets installed is like a database for the npm.
    # Every dependency in node_module will have its package.json.
    Node modules are very heavy so we should always put this in git ignore.
# üì¢ NOTE: Never touch node_modules and package-lock.json

# To ignite our app:
    npx parcel index.html
    -> npx means ‚Äòexecute using npm‚Äô
    -> index.html is the entry point.

# Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
    # It means that parcel will keep a track of all the files which you are updating.
    # There is File Watcher Algorithm (written in C++). It keeps track of all the files
        which are changing realtime and it tells the server to reload. These are all done by PARCEL.

# parcel-cache:
    # Parcel caches code all the time.
    # When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
    # If we make any code changes and save the application, another build will be triggered which 
        might take even less time than the previous build. This reduction of time is due to parcel cache.
    # Parcel immediately loads the code from the cache every time there is a subsequent build.
    # On the very first build parcel creates a folder .parcelcache where it stores the caches in 
        binary codeformat.
    # Parcel gives faster build, faster developer experience because of caching.

# dist:
    # It keeps the files minified for us.
    # When bundler builds the app, the build goes into a folder called dist.
    # The /dist folder contains the minimized and optimised version the source code.
    # Along with the minified code, the /dist folder also comprises of all the compiled modules that 
        may or may not be used with other systems.

    # When we run command:
            npx parcel index.html
        -> This will create a faster development version of our project and serves it on the server.
    
    # When I tell parcel to make a production build:
            npx parcel build index.html
        -> It creates a lot of things, minify your file. And the parcel will build all the production 
            files to the dist folder.

# Transitive Dependencies :
    # We have our package manager which takes care of our transitive dependencies of our code.
    # If we‚Äôve to build a production ready app which uses all optimisations 
        (like minify, bundling, compression, etc), we need to do all these.
    # But we can‚Äôt do this alone, we need some dependencies on it. Those dependencies are also 
        dependent on other dependencies.

# Browserslist:
    # Browserslist is a tool that specifies which browsers should be supported/compatible in your frontend app.
    # It makes our code compatible for a lot of browsers.
    In package.json file do:

# what is Tree Shaking?
   ‚óè Tree shaking is a process of removing the unwanted code that we do not use while developing 
        the application.
   ‚óè In computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.


=====================

###  What is `npm`?
   ‚óè npm is a package manager primarily for JavaSript.
   ‚óè npm actually has `no full form` but many places it is mentioned as `Node Package Manager`.
   ‚óè npm is world's largest software registry where developers(or many organizations) can share 
        or borrow packages for projects.

# Package Manager:
  ‚óè Package manager is a tool that helps to `manage the dependencies` in the Project.
  ‚óè It automates the process of `installing, upgrading & removing packages` and helps 
    to develop & miantain applications easily.
    EX: `npm`, `yarn` etc.

# Module:
   ‚óè A module is a `single file (or group of files)` containing JavaScript code that can be 
        exported and used in other files by importing it.
   ‚óè It `encapsulates related functionality`, for code organization and reusability.
   ‚óè You can define modules using `import and export` statements in JS(ES6 modules).

# Package:
   ‚óè A package is a `collection of modules` that are bundled together and distributed as 
        a single unit.
   ‚óè It includes a `package.json` file that contains `meta data`, `dependencies`, `versioning` etc.
   ‚óè It can be installed via package manager like `npm or yarn`.

# Library:
   ‚óè A library is a `collection of reusable code` that provides specific functionalities. 
   ‚óè It can be a `single module` or a `collection of modules (or a package)`.

# NOTE:
   ‚óè All above definitions are generic for module, package & library.
   ‚óè In `JS(or in npm ecosystem)`, these terminologies are used `interchangably`.
   EX: `React` is considered as both `package & library`.
        React is a library provide functionalities for building web apps.
        React is distributed as a npm package which can be installed via npm and
        it also has package.json file.

# CLI(Command Line Interface):
  ‚óè CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with programs via a comman line or terminal.
  ‚óè CLI takes input as text & responds with text as output unlike GUIs(no need of GUIs).

# CLI Tools:
  ‚óè CLI Tools are `command-line-based applications` instead of GUI to perform tasks in command
    prompt or terminal.
    EX: npm (npm install react),
        Git (git clone <repository-url>),
        Angular CLI (ng serve),
        Webpack CLI (webpack --config webpack.config.js)

   ‚óè `Uses`: 
        - They are `speed, flexible` and `ease of automation`.
        - They are more eficient to manage & streamline development process and manage apps.
        - Useful in managing `remote servers`, where GUIs may not be available or practical.

   ‚óè How to get `CLI Tools`?
   ‚óè `NPM`:   
        - npm, node from `Node.js`(.msi installer file).
        - npm is maintained by `Microsoft`(through its subsidiary `GitHub`) and 
            is an `open-source` tool.
   ‚óè `Git`: 
        - git, git bash from `Git`(.exe file).
        - Git is maintained by the `Linux Foundation` and is an `open-source` tool.

   ‚óè Both `npm & git` through CLI using `winget`(included in WIN 10, 11) or `Chocolatey`.

# Terminal:
   ‚óè Terminal in VS Code is an `integrated command-line interface` (CLI).
   ‚óè It allows you to execute commands directly within the editor, without switching 
        to an external terminal application.
        
    EX: powershell (Windows (available on macOS and Linux too)),
        command prompt, (Windows),
        Git Bash (Cross-platform (part of Git for Windows)),
        Javascript debug terminal (Cross-platform, integrated with VS Code‚Äôs debugging environment)
