-> Explore about react native and where it is used?
-> About DOM manipulation in react nd other JS libs & frameworks.
-> About React createElement, object and render in React - what happens BTS?


------------
React is Javascript library

React: 
    -> React is a core react library responsible for handling component structure, state and lifecycle.
ReactDOM: 
    -> React DOM library is responsible for rendering React compnents to DOM.

Are both libraries required?:
    -> React can be used in multiple environments like:
         React native for mobile Apps where react DOM is not required. React provides core logic for
         handling components and react DOM deals with web specific operation like DOM manipulation.
    -> For web project both are required and for mobile Apps React DOM is not required. So, it's better
        split into two libraries and use it according to the requirements.

React Native: 
    -> React Native renders on native mobile components(like Android & IOS) rather than browser DOM.

    -> React Native relies on APIs provided by the react native to manage styling, layouts and 
        interaction with components in mobile environment. It doesn't depend on web's DOM.

Uses: 
    -> React native can be used primarily for building Mobile Apps(like Android and IOS).
        It can be used for other plat forms like:
            1. Mobile Apps(IOS and Android).
            2. Windows & Mac OS desktop apps.
            3. TV platforms.
            4. React native web apps.
