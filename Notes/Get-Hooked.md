# Why do we use React? Some of us might wonder why we don't just stick to HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT for everything we've been doing?
‚óè Of course! It's absolutely possible to accomplish `everything using regular HTML,`
    `CSS and JAVASCRIPT without using REACT`. However, we chose React because it enhances
    our `developer experience`, making it more `seamless and efficient`.

# Introducing React-Hooks.
 
# Folder structure & Best practices.
‚óè We are going to Restructure our project folder. There is a very `good convention` in the
    industry that `all the code` in a React project is kept in a `src-folder`.
‚óè There is `no compulsion` to use a `src-folder` in a project. But here we are following 
    what the `industry follows`.
‚óè The `best practice` is to make `separate files for every component`.
‚óè When we are creating separate `component files` inside the ‚Äòcomponents-folder‚Äô always 
    start with a `capital letter` like.
            1. Header.js
            2. Body.js

üì¢ NOTE: `We can use (.jsx)` as an extension `instead of (.js)` it's up to the developer's wish.
        1. Header.jsx
        2. Body.jsx

üì¢ NOTE: `NO Thumb Rule` to use this convention, we could use `any folder structure` you wish.

# Understanding Export and Import in React.
‚óè Two types of export/import in React, We will understand each of them in details.
        1.Default export/import.
        2.Named export/import.


# 1.Default export/import.
Step-1 (export)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>
‚óè We use the `export` and `default` keywords with the component name at the end of 
    the component file.
    Syntax:
        `export default Header`;
    Or we can write with extension.
    `export default Header.js`;

Step-2 (import)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>
‚óè We use `import` with the component name at the start of the file.
Understand the Syntax properly.
    Syntax:
        `import Header from "./components/Header`

üì¢ NOTE:
‚óè We `don't` have to put an `extension in the file in the import statement`.
    If want to put then completely Fine.

üì¢ NOTE:
‚óè we `never put` any `hard-coded data` like the source-URL of logo and images inside the 
    `component file`. That's not the best practice the industry follows.
‚óè We need to put all hard coded data in `constants files`.

# 2.Named export/import.
‚óè Just write the `export` keyword before the variables we want to export 
Step-1 (export)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>
    `export const LOGO_URL = "<URL Path>"`;
Step-2 (import)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>
    `import { LOGO_URL } from "../utils/constants"`;
‚óè When we import there is a slight difference in syntax we use curly braces.

# Can we use default export with named export ?
 yes

# Imp points.
‚óè `Use map()` method to go through each item in `array list & map` the items instead of for loops.

üì¢ Note:
‚óè Whenever we have react App we have a `UI layer and data layer`, UI layer will display
    what is being sent by the data layer.

# How can we display filtered restaurants dynamically on UI(display screen) ?
‚óè we require a `superpowerful React variable` known as a `state variable`.

# How do we create Super-powerful variable ?
‚óè For that we use `React Hooks`.

# What is Hook ?
‚óè It's simply a `regular JavaScript function`. However, it becomes 
    `powerful when used within React`, as it's provided to us by React itself.
‚óè These pre-built functions have underlying logic developed by React developers. 
    When we install React via npm, we gain access to these superpowers.
`Two crucial hooks` we frequently utilize are:
    1. useState()
    2. useEffect()

# useState()
(import)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî>
‚óè First, we have to `import` as a `named import` from `react`. We use useState() 
    inside the component to create a ‚Äòstate variable‚Äò. 
    `import { useState } from "react"`;
    Syntax of useState():
        `const [listOfRestaurant] = useState([])`;

‚óè In the provided code, we pass an `empty array []` as the initial value inside 
    the useState([]) method. This empty array `serves as the default value` for the 
    listOfRestaurant variable.

‚óè If we pass the listOfRestaurant(with any data) `data inside the useState()` as the 
    default data, it will `render the data` on the screen using that initial data.

# How could we modify the datam?
‚óè To modify we pass the second argument setListOfRestaurant we can name as we wish. 
    setListOfRestaurant used to update the list.
    Syntax of useState():
        `const [listOfRestaurant , setListOfRestaurant] = useState([])`;

# How can we display updated data dynamically on UI(display screen)? 
‚óè The crucial point about `State variables` is that whenever they `update`, React 
    `triggers a reconciliation cycle` and `re-renders the component`.
‚óè This means that as soon as the `data layer changes`, React promptly `updates the UI layer`.
    The `data layer` is always kept in `sync with the UI layer`.
‚óè To achieve this rapid operation, React employs a `reconciliation algorithm`, also known 
    as the `diffing algorithm or React-Fibre` which we will delve into further below.

# React is often praised for its speed, have you ever wondered why? ü§î
‚óè At the core lies `React-Fiber` - a powerhouse `reimplementation of React's core algorithm`. 
    The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures.
‚óè Its headline feature is `incremental rendering`: the ability to split rendering work into chunks
    and spread it out over multiple frames.
‚óè These days, we can use JavaScript and React alongside popular libraries like GSAP 
    (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Three.js.
‚óè These tools allow us to create animations and 3D designs using the capabilities of JavaScript and React.

# But how does it all work behind the scenes?
‚óè When you `create elements in React`, you're actually `creating virtual DOM objects`. 
    These virtual replicas are synced with the real DOM, a process known as 
        `"Reconciliation" or the React "diffing" algorithm`.
‚óè Essentially, every `rendering cycle compares` the `new UI` blueprint(updated VDOM) with 
    the `old one (previous VDOM)` and makes precise changes to the actual DOM accordingly.
‚óè It's important to understand these fundamentals in order to unlock a world of possibilities for 
    front-end developers!

In React.js, the terms **Virtual DOM**, **Reconciliation**, **React Fiber**, **Rendering**, and **Diff Algorithm**:

---

### 1. **Virtual DOM**
- The **Virtual DOM** is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
- React uses this lightweight version of the DOM to perform updates efficiently.
- When the state or props of a React component change, a new Virtual DOM tree is created and 
    compared with the previous one.

**Key Role**: It acts as an intermediate layer between the application's state and the actual browser DOM.

### 2. **Reconciliation**
- **Reconciliation** is the process by which React updates the DOM to match the Virtual DOM.
- It involves comparing the new Virtual DOM with the old Virtual DOM and finding the minimal set of changes required (using the Diff Algorithm).
- React applies these changes (or patches) to the real DOM.

**Key Role**: Ensures that React updates only the parts of the UI that actually changed, 
        optimizing performance.

### 3. **React Fiber**
- **React Fiber** is the re-implementation of React's core algorithm introduced in React 16.
- It enhances React's ability to handle rendering by breaking rendering tasks into smaller units of work (fiber nodes).
- It introduces the concept of **time slicing**, allowing React to prioritize and pause low-priority tasks (like rendering) in favor of high-priority tasks (like user input).

**Key Role**: Improves the rendering process by making it incremental and interruptible, 
        leading to better responsiveness.

### 4. **Rendering**
- **Rendering** is the process of generating the UI by converting React components into the 
        DOM elements displayed in the browser.
- Rendering happens in two phases:
  1. **Render Phase**: React builds the Virtual DOM and determines what changes are needed.
  2. **Commit Phase**: React applies these changes to the actual DOM.

**Key Role**: Translates React components into a visible interface.

### 5. **Diff Algorithm**
- The **Diff Algorithm** is a technique used by React to determine the difference between the
        old and new Virtual DOM trees.
- It is optimized for performance by assuming:
  1. Elements with the same type and key are the same.
  2. Elements of different types or keys are entirely replaced.
- The algorithm efficiently calculates the minimal set of updates needed to transition from the
        old tree to the new tree.

**Key Role**: Powers Reconciliation by identifying which parts of the DOM need updates.

### Relation and Connection Between These Terms
- **Virtual DOM**: Acts as the abstraction layer for efficient updates.
- **Diff Algorithm**: Compares old and new Virtual DOM trees during **Reconciliation** to determine changes.
- **Reconciliation**: Applies the updates identified by the Diff Algorithm to the actual DOM.
- **React Fiber**: Optimizes and schedules the Reconciliation and Rendering processes to ensure 
    smooth UI performance.
- **Rendering**: The final step where changes are committed to the real DOM.

### Workflow Summary
1. **State/Props Change** ‚Üí Triggers a new **Virtual DOM** tree generation.
2. **Diff Algorithm** ‚Üí Compares the new and old Virtual DOM trees.
3. **Reconciliation** ‚Üí Determines the minimal changes needed and prepares updates.
4. **React Fiber** ‚Üí Schedules and prioritizes these updates.
5. **Rendering** ‚Üí Applies changes to the real DOM, updating the UI.

Note: This layered approach ensures React is fast, responsive, and efficient in managing complex UIs.
