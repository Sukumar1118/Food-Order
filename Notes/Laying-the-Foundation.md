# What is another way of starting the build of the project?

‚óè We will be `creating scripts` instead of using ‚Äúnpx parcel index.html‚Äù.
‚óè We can create `different scripts` for starting our project in Development and Production.

    In package.json , in the script section write the following command.
    "Scripts": {
        "start": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html"
    }
Note: If you‚Äôre not sure how to `start the project in a new company` then find these 
        `scripts in package.json` and use them.

# Scripts in package.json:
‚óè In a package.json file, the scripts section is used to `define custom commands` that 
    you can run using `npm run <script-name>`.
‚óè These scripts can `automate tasks like building, testing, linting, and starting your application`.
‚óè `npm run start` is the `general form & correct way` for running any script.
‚óè `npm start` is a `shortcut` specifically for the "start" script.

# Introducing JSX - why JSX?
‚óè Before we begin, we have to remove the existing React Code from App.js where we used 
        React.createElement() for displaying content on the webpage but its syntax is very bad.
‚óè It‚Äôs not developer friendly, and very hard to read. To solve this problem Facebook developers
        built JSX.
‚óè JSX makes developer life easy as we no longer have to write our code using React.createElement().

üì¢ NOTE: We write `code for both Machines and Humans` but first for Human understanding as it is read 
            by a lot of developers.

# What is JSX?
‚óè JSX is `HTML-like or XML-like syntax`. JSX stands for `JavaScript XML`.
‚óè It's a `syntax extension` for JavaScript.
‚óè It is `not a part of React`. React apps can be built even `without JSX` but the code will become 
    very hard to read.
‚óè It is `not HTML inside JavaScript`.
‚óè JavaScript engine cannot understand JSX as it `only understands ECMAScript`.

# Introducing Babel

# Is JSX a valid JavaScript?
‚óè The answer is `yes and no`.
‚óè JSX is `not a valid Javascript syntax` as it‚Äôs not pure HTML or pure JavaScript for a browser to understand.
‚óè JS does not have `built-in JSX`.
‚óè The JS engine `does not understand JSX` because the JS engine `understands ECMAScript or ES6+ code`.

# If the browser can‚Äôt understand JSX how is it still working?
‚óè This is because of Parcel because `Parcel is a Beast`.
‚óè Before the code gets to JS Engine it is `sent to Parcel and Transpiled` there. 
    Then after transpilation, the `browser gets the code that it can understand`.
‚óè `Transpilation` ‚áí Converting the code in such a `format that the browsers can understand`.
‚óè Parcel is like a manager who gives the `responsibility of transpilation` to a package called `Babel`.
‚óè Babel is a package that is a `compiler/transpiler of JavaScript` that is already present inside       `node-modules`.
‚óè It takes JSX and `converts it into the code that browsers understand`, as soon as we write it and save the  file.
‚óè Babel is `not created by Facebook`.

Note: `JSX(transpiled by Babel)` ‚áí `React.createElement` ‚áí  `ReactElement` ‚áí 
                `JS Object` ‚áí `HTML Element(render)`.

# How JSX works internally in React?
‚óè Babel transpiles JSX, it `translates JSX into function calls(by default React.createElement)`
    that can create elements.
‚óè It takes care of creating the element structure `described by the JSX code`.
‚óè You need to add either the `@babel/preset-react` preset or the `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` plugin
    to enable JSX transpilation.
‚óè JSX works with `any library` that provides a `createElement-like function` compatible with its 
    output structure. 
‚óè This function `doesn‚Äôt need to be React.createElement` specifically, it can be any function 
    that knows how to `interpret JSX inputs` to create a structured representation of 
    `elements that the library can later render`.

# What is the difference between HTML and JSX?
‚óè JSX is `not HTML. It‚Äôs HTML-like syntax`.
‚óè HTML uses `class` property whereas JSX uses `className` property.
‚óè HTML can use `hypens` in `property names` whereas JSX uses `camelCase syntax`.

üì¢ NOTE:    
‚óè Use `Prettier - Code Formatter` VS Code Extension to make your code look beautiful with proper formatting.
‚óè Use `ES lint` VS Code Extension for linting.
‚óè Use `Better Comments` VS Code Extension to beautify your comments.
‚óè Use `Bracket Pair Colorization Toggler` extension for bracket colors.

# Introducing React Components
‚óè `Everything inside React is a component`.

# What are Components?
‚óè There are 2 types of components:
        1.`Class-based Components` - Old way of writing code, used rarely in industry.
        2.`Functional Components` - New way of writing code, most commonly used.

# What is a React Functional Components?
‚óè It is just a `JavaScript Function that returns some JSX or a react element`.
‚óè Always `name` React Functional Component with `Capital Letters` otherwise you will confuse it 
    with normal function.

# Components Composition
‚óè A `component inside a component`. 
‚óè `Calling a component inside another component` is Component Composition.

# How to use JavaScript code inside JSX?
‚óè Inside a React Component when `{}` parenthesis is present we can write any JavaScript expression inside it.
    const number = 10000;
    const HeadingComponent = () => (
    <div id="containter">
        {number}
        <h1>Namaste React</h1>
    </div>
    )

# How to call React Element in JSX?
‚óè We can use `{}` parenthesis.

# What will happen if we call 2 elements inside each other?
‚óè If we put `2 components inside each other`, then it will go into an `infinite loop` and the stack will    overflow.
‚óè It will `freeze your browser`, so it‚Äôs not recommended to do so.

# Advantages of using JSX.
1) `Sanitizes the data`:
    ‚óè If someone gets access to your JS code and sends some malicious data which will then get 
        displayed on the screen, that attack is called cross-site scripting.
    ‚óè It can read cookies, local storage, session storage, get cookies, get info about your device, 
        and read data.
    ‚óè JSx takes care of your data.
    ‚óè If some API passes some malicious data JSX will escape it.
    ‚óè It prevents cross-site scripting and sanitizes the data before rendering.
2) `Makes code readable`:
    ‚óè JSX makes it easier to write code as we are no longer creating elements using React.createElement().
3) `Makes code simple and elegant`.
4) `Show more useful errors and warnings`.
5) `JSX prevents code injections`(attacks).

`Term`	     `Purpose`	                                          `Example`
Plugin	    | Adds `individual functionality` or transformations | @babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions,
              to a tool.                                           @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx

Preset	    | `Collection of related plugins`, often for         | @babel/preset-react
              specific environmnet or framework.	

Toolchain	| `Set of tools` that work together for series of    | Babel, Webpack, ESLint
              `multiple development tasks` like ranspiling, 
              bundling, minifying, and testing code etc.

## Babel features:

# Transpilation:
‚óè Babel converts `newer JavaScript` syntax (like ES6, ES7, etc.) into `older JavaScript (ES5)` 
    to ensure `compatibility with older browsers`.
  Example: Converting `arrow functions` (()=>) to `traditional functions`.

# Polyfilling:
‚óè Babel can `include polyfills  for modern JavaScript features` not natively supported in 
    older environments, such as `Promise` etc.
‚óè It uses: `@babel/preset-env along with core-js`;

# JSX Transformation:
‚óè Babel transforms `JSX syntax into JavaScript code` that browsers can execute especially
    in React apps.
‚óè Preset: `@babel/preset-react`

# It has other features like `TypeScript Compilation`, `Code Optimization` etc.
